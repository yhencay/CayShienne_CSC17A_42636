 * Purpose: Homework 3.12
 * 
 * Problem: Complete the following program skeleton so it asks the user to enter
 *    a character. Store the character in the variable letter. Use a type cast
 *    expression with the variable in a cout statement to display the characterâ€™s
 *    ASCII code on the screen.
 * 
 *      #include <iostream>
 *      using namespace std;
 *      int main() {
 *          char letter;
 *          // Finish this program
 *          // as specified above.
 *          return 0;
 *      }

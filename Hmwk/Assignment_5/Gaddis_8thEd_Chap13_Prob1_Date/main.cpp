 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Shienne Cay
 * Created on May 4, 2017, 9:20 PM
 * Purpose: Homework #1 Date
 * 
 * Problem: Design a class called Date. The class should store a date in three 
 *      integers: month, day , and year. There should be member functions to 
 *      print the date in the following forms:
 *               12/25/2014
 *               December 25, 2014
 *               25 December 2014
 *    Demonstrate the class by writing a complete program implementing it.
 *  Input Validation: Do not accept values for the day greater than 31 or less 
 *     than 1. Do not accept values for the month greater than 12 or less than 1.
